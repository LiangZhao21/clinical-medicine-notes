# Neurologic Examination
## Physical Examination
1. Higher Cortical Functions
    - Orientation
    - Insight into illness
    - Language assessed during taking of the history

1. Contiousness
    - Size of pupils
    - Reaction to light
    - Visual and auditory acuity

1. Cranial Nerves: Movement of eyes, face and tongue

1. Motion System
    - Atrophy: examination of outstretched hands
    - Pronating or downward drift
    - Tremor
    - Power of grip
    - Wrist dorsiflexion
    - Tendon Reflexes: Biceps, Supinator, Triceps, Patellar, Achilles, Plantar

1. Sensation System
    - Vibration sensibility in fingers and toes

1. Coodination: Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin

1. Gait

## Lumbar Puncture

Risk of Lumbar Puncture (LP)

- High
    - Papilledema resulting from intracranial mass
    - Asymmetric lesions, esp. near the tentorium or foramen magnum

- Considerably Low
    - SAH
    - Hydrocephalus with communication between all the ventricles
    - Pseudo-tumor cerebri

## Examination of CSF
1. Pressure
    - 100 - 180 mmH₂O
    - 8 - 14 mmHg

1. Color

    - erythrochromia: (supernatant fluid) pink-red, observed a few hours after RBCs begin to hemolyze in SAH.

    - xanthochromia: (supernatant fluid) yellow-brown
        - More than a day after RBCs begin to hemolyze in SAH. (RBC > 100,000 /mm³, with contamination of bilirubin and lipochromes).
        - Jaundice
        - Elevation of CSF protein (Albumin > 150 mg/100ml, due to albumin-bound fraction of bilirubin)
        - Hypercarotenemia
        - Hyperglobinemia

1. Cellularity: Fewer than 5 lymphocytes or other mononuclear cells per cubic millimeter
    - Elevation of WBC
        - Inflammation (infectious or immunologic)
        - Hemorrhage
        - Chemical substances
        - Neoplasm
        - Vasculitis
    - Elevation of eosinophilic leukocytes
        - Parasitic infections
        - Hodgkin disease
        - Neurosyphilis
        - Cholesterol emboli

1. Protein: 45 - 50 mg/dL in basal cisterns (or 5 - 15 in ventricles)
    - Obscure: &lt; 75 mg/dL
    - Spillage: 1mg increase of protein per 1,000 RBCs
    - SAH: many times the ratio of spillage, for the irritating effect of RBC upon the leptomeninges
    - Bacterial meningitis: > 500 mg/dL
    - Viral infections: 50 - 100 mg/dL but sometimes can be normal or up to 200 mg/dL
    - Paraventricular tumors: > 100 mg/dL
    - Guillain-Barré syndrome: Elevation of protein level while cell count remains normal. Can be greater than 500 mg/dL
    - Block to CSF flow: (Frobin syndrome) > 1,000 mg/dL, with xanthochromia and clots readily
    - Partial CSF block: 100 - 200 mg/dL, by ruptured discs or tumor
    - Meningismus: low protein values (febrile illness with signs of meningeal irritation but normal CSF)

    Low CSF protein values are observed in meningismus, hyperthyroidism, or in conditions that produce low CSF pressure.

1. Glucose: 45 - 80 mg/dL, about ⅔ of that in the blood

   CSF glucose reduce in bacterial meningitis probably due to impairment of the membrane transfer system

    - Abnormal low CSF glucose with pleocytosys
        - bacterial meningitis
        - tuberculous
        - fungal meningitis
    - Abnormal low CSF glucose without pleocytosys
        - Widespread neoplastic infiltration of meninges
        - Sarcoidosis
        - SAH (usually in the 1st week)
        - Chemically induced inflammation
